              Fanfiction is a vast network of communities that are created, run,
              and populated by you, the Fanfiction users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through these communities, you can post, comment, vote, discuss,
              learn, debate, support, and connect with people who share your
              interests, and we encourage you to find-or even create-your home
              on Fanfiction.
            </p>
            <p>
              While not every community may be for you (and you may find some
              unrelatable or even offensive), no community should be used as a
              weapon. Communities should create a sense of belonging for their
              members, not try to diminish it for others. Likewise, everyone on
              Fanfiction should have an expectation of privacy and safety, so
              please respect the privacy and safety of others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every community on Fanfiction is defined by its users. Some of
              these users help manage the community as moderators. The culture
              of each community is shaped explicitly, by the community rules
              enforced by moderators, and implicitly, by the upvotes, downvotes,
              and discussions of its community members. Please abide by the
              rules of communities in which you participate and do not interfere
              with those in which you are not a member.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below the rules governing each community are the platform-wide
              rules that apply to everyone on Fanfiction. These rules are
              enforced by us, the admins.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h1>Rules</h1>
            </p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  1. Remember the human. Fanfiction is a place for creating
                  community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or
                  vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use
                  Fanfiction free of harassment, bullying, and threats of
                  violence. Communities and users that incite violence or that
                  promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be
                  banned.
                </li>
                <li>
                  2. Abide by community rules. Post authentic content into
                  communities where you have a personal interest, and do not
                  cheat or engage in content manipulation (including spamming,
                  vote manipulation, ban evasion, or subscriber fraud) or
                  otherwise interfere with or disrupt Fanfiction communities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  3. Respect the privacy of others. Instigating harassment, for
                  example by revealing someone’s personal or confidential
                  information, is not allowed. Never post or threaten to post
                  intimate or sexually-explicit media of someone without their
                  consent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  4. Do not post or encourage the posting of sexual or
                  suggestive content involving minors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  5. You don’t have to use your real name to use Fanfiction, but
                  don’t impersonate an individual or an entity in a misleading
                  or deceptive manner.
                </li>
                <li>
                  6. Ensure people have predictable experiences on Fanfiction by
                  properly labeling content and communities, particularly
                  content that is graphic, sexually-explicit, or offensive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  7. Keep it legal, and avoid posting illegal content or
                  soliciting or facilitating illegal or prohibited transactions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  8. Don’t break the site or do anything that interferes with
                  normal use of Fanfiction.
                </li>
              </ul>
